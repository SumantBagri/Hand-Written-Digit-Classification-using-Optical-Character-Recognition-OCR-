# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification-using-Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-
Hand written digits(ranging from 0-9) are classified using a pre-trained text recognition module, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), available on Matlab. The process involves capturing an image using the ArduCAM peripheral for Arduino and subsequently performing image processing for digit calssification on Matlab.
